The dataset comprised of processed data produced in Zelezniak at al, Cell Systems 2018 study. 



MODEL TO PREDICT GLYCOLISIS AND PPP INTERMEDIATES USING QUANTITATIVE PROTEOMICS of yeast (Saccaromyces cerevisiae) strains

Proteomics data need to be quantified y processed accroding to the above cited paper and input data should have the structure as "example.csv"
in order to be runned through the notebook nr.3.

Output will be a new dataframe with predicted values of each metabolite (for each, specific features are selected and a specific model is applied)
and for each yeast strain.
